Tableau Public is used to visualize the query result from sql.

As Tableau public does not connect with database. What was done here was to: 

1.extract query results into excel, 

2.import excel to Tableau public to have data visualized.


###Extra notes from project implementation:

Duing the data tranformation of quried data results from sql to tableasu. All the "Null" were replaced by 0, so that the columns would be assigned as numeric when data tables were imported into Tableau.

Data type in Column Date were changed from datetime to date in excel.

Adjust the format of DeathPercentage in Sheet "Global numbers" from no decimals to with 4 decimals

During the visualization of "Percent Population Infected", a few countries' data were selected for visualization.
